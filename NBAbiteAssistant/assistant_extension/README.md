# NBAbite Streaming Assistant

## Description

NBAbite assistant helps with streaming sports games on nbabite.com, but will also work for other sports such as NFL and MMA

The assistant comes into use when you select your stream provider and are directed to link retrieval page. The page will say your link is loading, and three seconds later will display 'Your Link is Ready'. This is the time in which NBAAssistant can perform its functionality.

NBAbite Assistant will retrieve the actual stream link from this site and open a new tab with the stream. Without the assistant, you will have to go through many more pop up ads before getting what you came for.
